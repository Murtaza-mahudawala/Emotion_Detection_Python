Emotion Detection Using Python and TensorFlow ðŸŽ­
Overview
This project is a deep learning-based solution to detect and classify human emotions from facial images. It identifies 7 emotions:

Angry
Disgust
Fear
Happy
Neutral
Sad
Surprise
The model is trained on a dataset of approximately 30,000 images, ensuring high accuracy and robustness across diverse settings.

Features
Accurate Emotion Detection: Leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for high performance.
Scalable: Easy to extend to more emotion classes or integrate with real-time applications.
Customizable: Flexible codebase for adapting to other datasets or use cases.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 2.x
Other libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras, etc.
To install dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The model was trained using publicly available datasets with labeled images for different emotions. You can download similar datasets from platforms like Kaggle or use your own.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
cd your-repo-link
2. Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
Ensure the images are organized in subfolders by emotion class (e.g., data/happy/, data/sad/).
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
3. Testing the Model
To evaluate the model on test images, use:

bash
Copy code
python test.py --image path/to/image.jpg
File Structure
train.py: Script to train the model.
test.py: Script to test the model with individual images.
model.h5: Pretrained model file.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
data/: Folder for storing training and testing datasets.
Results
Accuracy: Achieved X% accuracy on the validation set.
Sample Predictions:

Applications
Mental Health: Recognize signs of stress or sadness.
Customer Experience: Gauge emotional responses during interactions.
Education: Monitor student engagement and emotions in virtual classes.
