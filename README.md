Emotion Detection Using Python and TensorFlow ðŸŽ­
Overview
This project is a deep learning-based solution to detect and classify human emotions from facial images. It identifies 7 emotions:

Angry
Disgust
Fear
Happy
Neutral
Sad
Surprise
The model is trained on a dataset of approximately 30,000 images, ensuring high accuracy and robustness across diverse settings.

Features
Accurate Emotion Detection: Leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for high performance.
Scalable: Easy to extend to more emotion classes or integrate with real-time applications.
Customizable: Flexible codebase for adapting to other datasets or use cases.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 
Other libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras, etc.
To install dependencies, run:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The model was trained using publicly available datasets with labeled images for different emotions. You can download similar datasets from platforms like Kaggle or use your own.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Murtaza-mahudawala/Emotion_Detection_Python
cd your-repo-link
2. Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset:

File Structure
train.py: Script to train the model.
